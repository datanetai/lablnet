      <h3 class="project-headings mt-5 dark:text-gray-300">Problems Faced</h3>
      <p class="text-justify dark:text-gray-300">
        I wanted the backend of the system for account handling to be in Python,
        oh yes it is but I am still unable to host it because I can't afford the
        server!. Still, I have shared hosting. ðŸ˜”
      </p>
      <h3 class="project-headings mt-5 dark:text-gray-300">Lessons Learnt</h3>
      <p class="text-justify dark:text-gray-300">
        This was probably the first web app I developed in which I used
        tailwindCSS and learned about tailwindCSS. After working with
        tailwindCSS I want to use it for all my projects.
      </p>
      <h3 class="project-headings mt-5 dark:text-gray-300">Future Thoughts</h3>
      <p class="text-justify dark:text-gray-300">
        The functionality of the blog does not work properly and I need the site
        to allow users to log in to the system and manage their orders.

      <p class="text-justify">
          <ol class="list-disc mx-6 dark:text-gray-300">
              <li>Initially I built a backend in the flask to retrieve the data and used Ajax to retrieve the data but the only problem I have is that I do not have a server where I can host other than PHP applications.</li>
              <li>It was very frustrating because of this problem but this thought came to my mind. Instead of retrieving data from the server, we can create static JavaScript files directly and host them on GitHub and create a static site with VueJs.</li>
              <li>So, I made it a success with GitHub Actions [by the way, thanks to GitHub for providing the best functionality].</li>
              <li>The second problem I faced was about enabling frontend sites to support multiple countries but I solved it.</li>
          </ol>
