        I initially wanted the backend of the system to be in Python, but I was unable to host it because I could not afford a dedicated server. I am currently using shared hosting. ðŸ˜”

        This was one of the first web apps I developed that utilized tailwindCSS, and it was a great learning experience. I now plan to use tailwindCSS in all of my future projects.

        The blog functionality does not currently work as intended, and I would like to improve it. I also want to add a login system for users to manage their orders.

      <p class="text-justify dark:text-gray-300">
        The main purpose of this project is to create a fast COVID-19 dashboard and parser that can raise awareness among the public, visualize data for easy understanding, gather data for research and experiences, and provide a platform for the public to interact with the data.

      <p class="text-justify">
          <ol class="list-disc mx-6 dark:text-gray-300">
              <li>Initially I built a backend in the flask to retrieve the data and used Ajax to retrieve the data but the only problem I have is that I do not have a server where I can host other than PHP applications.</li>
              <li>It was very frustrating because of this problem but this thought came to my mind. Instead of retrieving data from the server, we can create static JavaScript files directly and host them on GitHub and create a static site with VueJs.</li>
              <li>So, I made it a success with GitHub Actions [by the way, thanks to GitHub for providing the best functionality].</li>
              <li>The second problem I faced was about enabling frontend sites to support multiple countries but I solved it.</li>
          </ol>
      </p>
