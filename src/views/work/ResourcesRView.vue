    <h3 class="project-headings mt-9 dark:text-gray-300">Purpose</h3>

    <p class="text-justify dark:text-gray-300">
      As a university student in Pakistan, I noticed a common problem among my peers: they did not have access to lectures, slides, and other resources on exam night. I decided to develop an Android application to address this issue, as my university did not have an app available. I used Dart, Flutter, and Firebase to create the app, and was pleasantly surprised by the positive response from students. However, the app did not last long due to issues with resource management.

      The purpose of this web app is similar to the previous project, but with a faster and more efficient design. I was able to compile the Flutter app to web, but it was very slow. Therefore, I developed the app in VueJs to improve its performance.

      The purpose of this command line app is to scrape data from the Riphah International University website and store it in Firebase. The main data we were interested in were related to faculty members.

    <h3 class="project-headings mt-5 dark:text-gray-300">Future Thoughts</h3>

    <p class="text-justify dark:text-gray-300">
      I plan to continue maintaining this app and add a configurable scraper so that it can be used on any website.
