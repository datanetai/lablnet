    <h3 class="project-headings mt-9 dark:text-gray-300">Purpose</h3>

    <p class="text-justify dark:text-gray-300">
      As a university student in Pakistan, a common problem faced by students is
      that they do not get lectures, slides and other resources on exam night.
      So I decided to make an application for my university. Although keep in
      mind that the university has its own portal, there is no app for it. So, I
      just sat for ten days and developed an Android application using Dart,
      Flutter and Firebase. I never thought it would help the students and it
      did, but it didn't last long.

      <ol class="list-disc mx-6">
        <li>The first issue was about maintaining the resources. I myself volunteered to add resources like lectures slides, textbooks, etc. But, now I wanted the CRs to do so who were quite lazy enough to do so.</li>
        <li>There was another frustrating issue related to Firebase Function as I was not able to get it because my Bank Card was not working at Google ðŸ¤”. So I add firebase rules by adding email manually.</li>
        <li>On the top of it, at that time Flutter was too young so have less support.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3 class="project-headings mt-5 dark:text-gray-300">Some Goodies</h3>
